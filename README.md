Spotify-applications

Work in progress...

...ideas:

1. Recreate 'Spotify Wrapped', they send this at the end of the year to every user to show them their top artists/songs, listening patterns, and other really interesting data.
2. From those top artists, then make a recommendation system to generate artists/songs on the fly.
3. Create a user interface that displays the information for top artists, flask? js?
